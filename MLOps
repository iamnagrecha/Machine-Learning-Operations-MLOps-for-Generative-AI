Training & deploying is Models time consuming

MLOps, helps operationalize ML Systems


Predictive & Generative AIs

Predictive- can't generate new contents, relying on pre-exsisting data, ex- regression, classification etc.
Gen AI- can produce new & original contents, by learning from existing data.

Traditional ML Workflow
Experiment-Train-Deploy-Predict

In Experimentation phase- leverage the pretrained models, using NLP Prompts.
with Gen AI- customize pre-trained models for fine tuning, curated data sets, rather then massive amts of labelled data.

In Curate data phase-
