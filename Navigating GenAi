Navigating GenAi

Challenges

1) Increased AI Infra for pretrained Models
Use Vertex AI to mitigate the above

- Model Garden
- Vertex AI Generative Studio-> GUI takes care of underline infrastructure

2) Customizing & tuning models

- SUpervised tuning
- Reinforcement learning with human feedback
- Data curation

3) Managing new artifacts
