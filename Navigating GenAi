Navigating GenAi

Challenges

1) Increased AI Infra for pretrained Models
Use Vertex AI to mitigate the above

- Model Garden
- Vertex AI Generative Studio-> GUI takes care of underline infrastructure

2) Customizing & tuning models

- SUpervised tuning
- Reinforcement learning with human feedback
- Data curation

3) Managing new artifacts

- Vertex AI Feature Store
- Vertex Model Registry
- Vertex AI Pipelines

4) Navigating evaluation & monitoring

- New evaluation metrics
- safety scores
- Recitation check

5) Connecting to enterprise data

- Embeddings and vector search
